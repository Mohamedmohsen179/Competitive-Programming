## Introduction

Competitive programming is a challenging and rewarding way to improve coding skills and algorithmic thinking. This repository includes my solutions to problems from:
- LeetCode
- Codeforces

Each solution is organized by platform and problem name for easy navigation.

## Languages Used

The primary languages used in this repository are:
- C++
- Python

Each solution file has a proper extension (`.cpp`, `.py`) based on the programming language used.

## Platforms

- **LeetCode:** A popular platform for practicing coding and algorithm problems.
- **Codeforces:** A platform for competitive programming contests.

## Directory Structure

The problems are organized into directories named after the platforms, and each problem has its own file. For example:
├── LeetCode
│ ├── problem1.cpp
│ ├── problem2.py
│ └── ...
├── Codeforces
│ ├── contest1
│ │ ├── problemA.cpp
│ │ ├── problemB.cpp
│ │ └── ...
│ ├── contest2
│ │ ├── problemA.py
│ │ ├── problemB.py
└── └── ...
